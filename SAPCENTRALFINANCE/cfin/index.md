reporting structure.

- Replication of CO internal postings

- Replication of cost objects

- Replication of commitments

- Replication of EC-PCA postings

SAP LT Replication Server is also used for the initial load of CO internal postings and cost objects. The initial load of FI data is managed via Customizing activities in the Central Finance system. You can access these Customizing activities in the Implementation Guide (IMG) by starting transaction SPRO and then choosing:
